# Parameter Shrinkage and Penalization Methods
 Math Departmental Honors Research Project in Statistics
 
This research focuses on assessing reading ability of elementary school children by applying statistical methods on collected data. Each child is given different passages to read and teachers mark how many words their student read wrong. We also collect another source of data through using an AI that analyzes students’ voices and automatically counts how many words they got incorrectly. 

Our purpose is to measure the measurement errors between two methods and apply different statistical distributions to see which distribution has the best potential to measure students’ reading ability accurately.

In this research, we use five different distributions: Poisson, binomial, beta binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated binomial.
